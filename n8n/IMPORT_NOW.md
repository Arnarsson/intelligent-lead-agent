# ‚ö° GET IT WORKING NOW - Step by Step

## üö® Current Status

Your webhook returns: **HTTP 404 - Not registered for POST requests**

This means: **NO workflow is active** on path `sa1`

---

## ‚úÖ Fix in 3 Minutes

### Step 1: Open n8n

Go to: **https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com**

### Step 2: Check for Active Workflows

1. Click **"Workflows"** in the left sidebar
2. Look for any workflows with:
   - Name containing "Lead Intelligence" or "Kickoff"
   - Path: `sa1`

**If you see any:**
- Click on the workflow name
- Check if toggle switch says "Active" (top-right)
- If **Inactive** ‚Üí Toggle it to **Active**
- If it's already active but not working ‚Üí **Deactivate it** (we'll replace it)

### Step 3: Import the CORS FIXED Workflow

**File Location:**
```
/Users/sven/Downloads/Lead Intelligence Kickoff - CORS FIXED.json
```

**Import Steps:**

1. In n8n, click **"Workflows"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Import from File"** button (top-right area)
3. **Select file:** `Lead Intelligence Kickoff - CORS FIXED.json`
4. Click **"Import"**
5. The workflow editor opens automatically

### Step 4: Activate the Workflow

1. In the workflow editor (top-right corner)
2. Toggle switch from **"Inactive"** to **"Active"**
3. Should turn green/blue showing "Active"

**IMPORTANT:** Only ONE workflow per webhook path can be active!

### Step 5: Test Immediately

**Terminal test:**
```bash
curl https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com/webhook/sa1 \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"contact":{"name":"Test"},"leadExamples":"Test data"}'
```

**Should return:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Kickoff data modtaget"
}
```

**Form test:**
1. Open: https://intelligent-lead-agent-nhzn2j02t-arnarssons-projects.vercel.app
2. Click: **"üß™ Udfyld testdata (TEST)"**
3. Click: **"Send formular"**
4. ‚úÖ Should see: **"Sendt! Vi har modtaget jeres kickoff‚Äëdata."**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Import from File" button not visible?

- Look for **"+"** button or **"Create workflow"** ‚Üí **"Import"**
- Or drag-and-drop the JSON file into the workflow list

### Multiple workflows with same path?

**n8n will only activate ONE workflow per path!**

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Workflows** list
2. For each workflow with path `sa1`:
   - Click workflow name
   - Check webhook node ‚Üí `path` parameter
   - If it's `sa1` and it's not the CORS FIXED one ‚Üí **Deactivate** it
3. Only keep **"Lead Intelligence Kickoff - CORS FIXED"** active

### Workflow activates but still 404?

**Causes:**
1. **Wrong path** - Check webhook node has `path: "sa1"` (not "webhook/sa1")
2. **Workflow didn't save** - Click "Save" after importing
3. **n8n cache** - Try deactivate ‚Üí save ‚Üí activate again

### Webhook works but form still fails?

**Check browser console (F12):**
- If you see **CORS error** ‚Üí OPTIONS is the issue, workflow needs explicit OPTIONS handler
- If you see **Network error** ‚Üí Check internet connection
- If you see **404** ‚Üí Workflow not active or wrong path

## üìä What Each Workflow File Does

In your Downloads folder:

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: `Lead Intelligence Kickoff - CORS FIXED.json`
- **Use this one!**
- Handles both OPTIONS and POST correctly
- Includes CORS headers in all responses
- Works with browsers (no CORS blocking)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative: `Lead Intelligence Kickoff - SIMPLE WORKING.json`
- Simpler structure
- May have CORS issues with browsers
- Good for testing with curl

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Original: `Lead Intelligence Kickoff Form Handler - FIXED.json`
- Has CORS headers but doesn't handle OPTIONS explicitly
- Browser may block due to preflight failure

---

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After activation, verify:

**1. n8n Shows Active**
- Workflow has "Active" badge/toggle
- Webhook URL shown as: `https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com/webhook/sa1`

**2. curl Returns 200 OK**
```bash
curl -X POST https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com/webhook/sa1 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"contact":{"name":"Test"},"leadExamples":"Test"}'

# Should return JSON with success: true
```

**3. Form Submits Successfully**
- No error message
- Shows: "‚úÖ Sendt! Vi har modtaget jeres kickoff‚Äëdata."
- Data appears in n8n Executions tab

**4. No Browser Errors**
- Open browser console (F12)
- No red CORS errors
- Network tab shows both OPTIONS and POST with 2xx status

## üéØ Quick Checklist

- [ ] n8n is open at https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com
- [ ] Old workflows with path `sa1` are deactivated
- [ ] CORS FIXED workflow is imported
- [ ] CORS FIXED workflow is activated (toggle ON)
- [ ] curl test returns `{"success": true}`
- [ ] Form test shows success message
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors
- [ ] n8n Executions tab shows successful runs

---

## üí° Why This Happened

**Your webhook worked earlier but now returns 404 because:**

1. **Workflow got deactivated** - Maybe manual deactivation or n8n restart
2. **Workflow was deleted** - Trying to fix the DataTable error
3. **Multiple workflows conflicting** - Only one can be active per path

**The fix:** Import CORS FIXED and activate it. Simple as that.

---

## üìû Still Stuck?

**Check these in order:**

1. **n8n Workflows page** - Is ANYTHING active with path `sa1`?
2. **Webhook node in workflow** - Does it show path `sa1` correctly?
3. **Workflow save status** - Is there an unsaved changes indicator?
4. **n8n error log** - Any errors showing in n8n UI?
5. **Browser console** - What exact error appears when form submits?

**Most common fix:** Deactivate ALL workflows with `sa1`, then activate only CORS FIXED.
