# üö® STOP - Delete Everything and Start Fresh

## The Problem

You're still using an OLD workflow. I can tell because:

- ‚ùå Node is called "Format Data" (should be "Extract Clean Fields")
- ‚ùå It's a SET node (should be CODE node)
- ‚ùå DataTable operation is "Update" (should be "Upsert")
- ‚ùå Input shows headers (should NOT have headers)

You need to DELETE all old workflows and import the ULTRA CLEAN one fresh.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: Delete ALL Old Workflows

1. **Go to n8n:** https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com
2. **Click "Workflows"** (left sidebar)
3. **For EACH workflow** you see that has "Lead" or "Kickoff" or "Intelligence" in the name:
   - Click the **3 dots** (‚ãÆ) next to the workflow name
   - Click **"Delete"**
   - Confirm deletion
4. **Make sure** you've deleted ALL of them

**Alternative if you want to keep them:**
- Just make sure they're ALL inactive (toggle OFF)
- And make sure NONE have path `sa1`

### Step 2: Import ULTRA CLEAN (Fresh)

1. **Click "Workflows"** (should be empty now)
2. **Click "Import from File"** (top-right)
3. **Select file:** `/Users/sven/Downloads/Lead Intelligence - ULTRA CLEAN.json`
4. **Click "Import"**

You should see the workflow editor open.

### Step 3: Verify You Have the RIGHT Workflow

**CHECK THESE THINGS:**

1. **Workflow name** at top should say: **"Lead Intelligence - ULTRA CLEAN"**

2. **Look for a node** called **"Extract Clean Fields"**
   - If you see "Format Data" ‚Üí WRONG workflow, delete and re-import
   - If you see "Extract Clean Fields" ‚Üí CORRECT! ‚úÖ

3. **Click on "Extract Clean Fields" node**
   - Should show JavaScript code
   - First line should say: `// Extract ONLY the fields we want - nothing else!`
   - If it shows a SET node configuration ‚Üí WRONG workflow

4. **Look at the DataTable node name**
   - Should say: **"Save to DataTable"**
   - NOT "Update row(s)" ‚ùå
   - NOT "Upsert row(s)" ‚ùå

5. **Check the connections**
   - Should be: `Extract Clean Fields ‚Üí Save to DataTable`
   - NOT: `Format Data ‚Üí anything`

### Step 4: Configure the DataTable Node

1. **Click on "Save to DataTable" node**
2. **Operation:** Should be **"Upsert"** (not Update)
3. **Data Table:** Select **"Kickoff Submissions"** (or your table name)
4. **Columns to Match On:** Add **"submittedAt"**
5. **Mapping Column Mode:** **"Map Automatically"**
6. **Click "Save"**

### Step 5: Activate

1. **Toggle "Active"** to ON (top-right)
2. You should see the workflow status change to "Active"

## üß™ Test It

### Terminal Test

```bash
curl -X POST https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com/webhook/sa1 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"contact":{"name":"Test"},"leadExamples":"Test data"}'
```

**Should return:**
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Kickoff data modtaget"}
```

### Form Test

1. Open: https://intelligent-lead-agent-nhzn2j02t-arnarssons-projects.vercel.app
2. Click "üß™ Udfyld testdata (TEST)"
3. Click "Send formular"
4. Should see success message

### Check the Execution

1. Go to **Executions** tab
2. Click latest execution
3. Click **"Extract Clean Fields"** node
4. Look at **OUTPUT**
5. **Should show ONLY 15 fields:**
   - submittedAt
   - contactName
   - referralSource
   - jobsites
   - jobsitePriority
   - leadExamples
   - minEmployees
   - maxEmployees
   - industries
   - geografi
   - funding
   - hubspotAPI
   - leadHandling
   - commChannel
   - notes

6. **Should NOT show:**
   - ‚ùå headers
   - ‚ùå params
   - ‚ùå query
   - ‚ùå body
   - ‚ùå webhookUrl

## üîç Visual Verification

### Correct Workflow (ULTRA CLEAN)

```
Webhook
  ‚Üì
Check HTTP Method
  ‚îú‚îÄ OPTIONS ‚Üí OPTIONS Response
  ‚îî‚îÄ POST ‚Üí Validate Required Fields
              ‚îú‚îÄ Valid ‚Üí Extract Clean Fields (CODE node)
              ‚îÇ            ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Save to DataTable
              ‚îÇ            ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Success Response
              ‚îî‚îÄ Invalid ‚Üí Error Response
```

**Node names you should see:**
- ‚úÖ Webhook
- ‚úÖ Check HTTP Method
- ‚úÖ OPTIONS Response
- ‚úÖ Validate Required Fields
- ‚úÖ **Extract Clean Fields** ‚Üê KEY NODE (Code node)
- ‚úÖ **Save to DataTable** ‚Üê DataTable node
- ‚úÖ Success Response
- ‚úÖ Error Response

**Total: 8 nodes**

### Wrong Workflow (Old ones)

If you see these node names, you have the WRONG workflow:
- ‚ùå Format Data (SET node)
- ‚ùå Format Data CLEAN (SET node)
- ‚ùå Upsert row(s) (old DataTable)
- ‚ùå Update row(s) (old DataTable)

**Delete it and import ULTRA CLEAN again!**

## üÜò Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: You imported but didn't activate

**Fix:** Toggle "Active" to ON after import

### Mistake 2: Multiple workflows active

**Fix:** Only ONE workflow with path `sa1` can be active at a time. Deactivate all others.

### Mistake 3: Imported wrong file

**Fix:** Make sure you selected "Lead Intelligence - ULTRA CLEAN.json" (not FOOLPROOF, not SIMPLE, not FIXED)

### Mistake 4: Still using old workflow

**Symptom:** Node names don't match (Format Data instead of Extract Clean Fields)

**Fix:** You didn't actually import the new one. Delete everything and re-import.

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

After completing all steps:

- [ ] ALL old workflows deleted or deactivated
- [ ] Imported "Lead Intelligence - ULTRA CLEAN.json"
- [ ] Workflow name shows "Lead Intelligence - ULTRA CLEAN"
- [ ] Node called "Extract Clean Fields" exists (CODE node)
- [ ] Node called "Save to DataTable" exists
- [ ] NO node called "Format Data"
- [ ] NO node called "Update row(s)"
- [ ] Workflow is activated (Active toggle ON)
- [ ] curl test returns success
- [ ] Form submission works
- [ ] Execution shows ONLY 15 fields in code node output
- [ ] NO headers/params/query/body in execution output

## üéØ Final Check

Before testing, take a screenshot of your workflow editor and verify:

1. **Top of editor** says "Lead Intelligence - ULTRA CLEAN"
2. **8 nodes** visible on canvas
3. **One node** has a `</>` icon (that's the Code node - "Extract Clean Fields")
4. **DataTable node** says "Save to DataTable"
5. **Connection** goes from Code node to DataTable

If ANY of these don't match ‚Üí You have the wrong workflow!

**File location again:** `/Users/sven/Downloads/Lead Intelligence - ULTRA CLEAN.json`

Delete everything, import THIS file, activate it, and it will work! üöÄ
