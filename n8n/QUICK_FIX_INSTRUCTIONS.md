# üîß Quick Fix for n8n Webhook - URGENT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem

Your webhook has 3 issues preventing the form from working:

1. ‚ùå **HTTP Method:** Not set to POST (currently defaults to GET)
2. ‚ùå **Response Mode:** Not configured to use "Respond to Webhook" nodes
3. ‚ùå **CORS Headers:** Missing (browser blocks the request)

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Import Fixed Workflow

### Step 1: Import the Fixed Workflow

1. **Go to n8n:** https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com
2. **Click:** Workflows ‚Üí **"Import from File"**
3. **Select:** `Lead Intelligence Kickoff Form Handler - FIXED.json` (saved in Downloads folder)
4. **Click:** Import

### Step 2: Activate the Workflow

1. **Toggle "Active"** to ON (top-right corner)
2. The webhook URL will be: `https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com/webhook/sa1`

### Step 3: Test It

**Using the form:**
1. Go to: https://intelligent-lead-agent-nhzn2j02t-arnarssons-projects.vercel.app
2. Click **"üß™ Udfyld testdata (TEST)"** button
3. Click **"Send formular"**
4. ‚úÖ Should see: "Sendt! Vi har modtaget jeres kickoff‚Äëdata."

**Using curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com/webhook/sa1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contact":{"name":"Test"},"leadExamples":"Test data"}'
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Kickoff data modtaget"
}
```

## üîç What Was Fixed?

### Before (BROKEN):
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "path": "sa1",
    "options": {}
  },
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook"
}
```

### After (FIXED):
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "path": "sa1",
    "httpMethod": "POST",           ‚Üê ADDED
    "responseMode": "responseNode", ‚Üê ADDED
    "options": {
      "responseHeaders": {          ‚Üê ADDED
        "entries": [
          {
            "name": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
            "value": "*"
          },
          {
            "name": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
            "value": "POST, OPTIONS, GET"
          },
          {
            "name": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
            "value": "Content-Type, Accept, Origin"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook"
}
```

## üéØ Key Changes Made

1. **Added `httpMethod: "POST"`**
   - Now accepts POST requests from the form
   - Previously only accepted GET requests

2. **Added `responseMode: "responseNode"`**
   - Tells webhook to wait for "Respond to Webhook" nodes
   - Fixes the "Unused Respond to Webhook node" error

3. **Added CORS Headers**
   - Allows the browser to make cross-origin requests
   - Without this, browser blocks the request before it reaches n8n

---

## üÜò If Still Not Working

### Check Browser Console

1. Open form in browser
2. Press **F12** (Developer Tools)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Fill test data and click submit
5. Look for errors (should see green success, not red errors)

### Check n8n Execution Log

1. Go to n8n ‚Üí Workflows ‚Üí "Lead Intelligence Kickoff Form Handler - FIXED"
2. Click **"Executions"** tab
3. Should see successful executions when form is submitted
4. Click on an execution to see the data flow

### Common Issues

**"CORS error" in browser console:**
- ‚Üí CORS headers not saved properly in webhook node
- ‚Üí Re-import the fixed workflow

**"404 Not Found":**
- ‚Üí Workflow is not active (toggle Active ON)
- ‚Üí Wrong webhook path (should be `/webhook/sa1`)

**"500 Internal Server Error":**
- ‚Üí Check n8n logs for specific error
- ‚Üí Make sure "Upsert row(s)" node has valid data table selected

---

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

After importing and activating:

- [ ] Workflow shows "Active" badge
- [ ] Webhook URL is `https://n8n.svenarnarsson.com/webhook/sa1`
- [ ] curl test returns `{"success": true}`
- [ ] Form submission shows success message
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Execution appears in n8n Executions tab
- [ ] Data is saved to data table (if configured)

---

## üìû Still Stuck?

If the above doesn't work:

1. **Export your current workflow** (for backup)
2. **Delete the old workflow** completely
3. **Import the FIXED workflow** fresh
4. **Configure data table** in "Upsert row(s)" node if needed
5. **Activate** and test

The fix is simple - the webhook node just needed 3 additional parameters!
